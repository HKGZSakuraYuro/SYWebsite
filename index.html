At Eren's tribunal, he insulted the merchants by calling them "pigs" and told the Military Police that they were not competent enough to handle Eren,[19] mocking several MPs by observing that they have never battled or even seen a single Titan. He even sardonically suggests that they join the Survey Corps, which caused them to back off. He openly resents most of the MPs for their continual attempts to undermine the Survey Corps, and also presumably because of the criminal life he led before he joined the Corps. </p>

Nonetheless, she is willing to take responsibility and apologizes should she fail in her task. Yelena appears to have a very relaxed demeanor, but appears to also have dry, humorous undertones to much of her actions.

Many have noted that Yelena is somewhat deranged in her zealotry; if any of her comrades are thought to have been working against their goals or insult those they are trying to ultimately save, Yelena would come forth and immediately kill them without hesitation.[2][3] It can also be argued that she is a sociopath, basking in the destruction of numerous airships and countless people while smiling and on the verge of tears.[4]  </p>

       <p>Petra looked up to Levi Ackerman as a captain and cared deeply for her team, but was notably at odds with Oluo, due to his tendency to imitate Levi.

Petra was kind and caring, as shown when she looked after and guided Eren when he was first admitted to the squad. She seemed to have acted as some sort of attachment figure for Eren among Levi's Squad as she was the one shown to worry about him. Although all of Levi's squad wished (and demanded, to an extent) Eren's unconditional trust, it was ultimately Petra who convinced him to do so.

Despite her kind nature, Petra was a conditioned soldier with a quick reaction time against perceived danger, such as the time when Eren accidentally transformed into a half Titan, she took an extreme reaction and interrogated him alongside her squad.[5] She also displayed extreme loyalty to her leaders and superiors and their orders.

She also showed the most remorse over her reaction to Eren's accidental transformation. Along with her comrades, she had bitten her hand just like Eren, signifying that they had established a close bond.   </p>

       <p>Oluo was a very self-confident, outspoken individual, and enjoyed boasting about his own prowess. Despite his obnoxious demeanor, he was the best out of Levi's Special Operations Squad; his 39 solo kills (highest solo kills out of his peers, bested only by Levi) fueled his haughty nature. Though Oluo tried to come across as self-important, his cockiness was rarely taken seriously, and he was also shown to be somewhat clumsy, frequently biting his own tongue on accident.[5]

Oluo also casually attempted to imitate Levi, such as his rough speech and confident attitude, which caused him to be at slight odds with Petra.

Despite this, he was very focused and disciplined in battle. He quickly accepted that Levi had a good reason for not revealing the truth about the 57th Expedition, even as the Female Titan was chasing them, and berated Eren for his undisciplined behavior. Even when Gunther was killed, he did not lose sight of his objective and remained completely focused on ensuring Eren's safety, not allowing his friend's death to affect him during the mission.

       <p>Mike was an acknowledged leader with a brave heart and a tactical mind. He was a loyal member of the Survey Corps and an adamant vanguard for mankind's freedom, believing humans can only lose when they stop fighting. During times of ease, Mike was shown to be a quiet man, rarely speaking unless it concerned a more serious matter. He also had a bizarre habit of "sniffing" people out when he met them. However, fellow squad leader Hange Zoë claimed he was a very capable leader, despite this strange habit which she claimed probably meant nothing.[7] He also cared a great deal for his squad, as he took on a great deal of Titans to allow them more time to escape. Mike felt sorry for putting the 104th recruits in such a vulnerable position during a Titan invasion.[8] In the end, despite his courage, Mike proved to have a breaking point. Trapped and helpless, he showed utter terror as he had been relieved of his equipment by the Beast Titan. However, he gathered his courage and raised his sword to continue the fight shortly after, but this moment of strength fell short as he could only scream in agony and horror as he was pulled apart by numerous Titans. In the end, Mike stayed true to his word to never stop fighting even when faced with overwhelming opposition.[9]   </p>

       <p>Being a soldier of the Survey Corps who survived multiple encounters with Titans significantly affected Gunther's personality. According to Levi, Gunther was chosen to be the part of the Special Operations Squad not only for this strength, but also due to the fact that he did not completely trust Eren Yeager. Even though Gunther and others were able to live through because of their ability to always expect the worst in any situation, they did not turn into heartless beasts as it was not easy for them to point their blades at Eren.[6] In the Special Operations Squad, Gunther seemed to be the most reasonable one. After Eren's unintentional transformation into a Titan, he was the only one to ask Eren for proof that he is not hostile. In contrast, Oluo threatened to kill him and Petra thought of Eren as dangerous while worrying about Levi's life.[7] However, he was shown to be irritated when his comrades and Eren were jokingly mocking each other about having wet their pants, implying he also possessed a stern side and did not take kindly if a soldier did not focus on the task at hand.  </p>

       <p>Gabi is very passionate and head-strong, expressing her emotions and opinion without inhibition. She is brave, possessing boundless determination, and willing to put her life on the line to complete a goal for a perceived greater good. She also shows great concern for her fellow Eldians, risking her life to take out a train instead of letting 800 of her brethren charge the gunmen guarding their objective.[7]

However, these attributes can also make her somewhat overbearing and domineering. This causes her to be tactless at times, forcing her opinions on others and taking charge regardless of whether it was asked for or not. She most usually shows this side around her fellow Warrior candidates, considering herself their de facto leader to an extent, and even threatening to 'punish' them when they disagree with her. Nonetheless, she is friendly enough that they have no issue with spending their leisure time with her.   </p>

       <p> Pixis is an eccentric man. While observing Titans breaching Wall Rose, he said he would not mind being eaten by a Titan if "it happened to be a stunning beauty." He retains a calm, and light-hearted demeanor, even in the midst of chaos, and he understands the strife and suffering of others, as he is seen allowing soldiers who wanted to leave because he understands the extreme amounts of terror and fear in those soldiers.[5] Yet, Pixis is an effective leader, as seen when he quiets all the soldiers attempting mutiny and successfully convinces them to continue fighting to retake Trost District. He is an expert strategist and is able to gauge a situation carefully, but also knows when to take risks, which lead to his decision to trust Eren Yeager to stop the breach. He is a man who makes smart choices, putting Ian Dietrich in charge of the alpha squad protecting Eren proved to be a wise move as Rico Brzenska and Mitabi Jarnach both called that they should give up on the operation, which Ian denied, that eventually led to being a success.  </p>

       <p>Historia Reiss (ヒストリア・レイス Hisutoria Reisu?) is the current Queen of the Walls. She is also the illegitimate child of the nobleman Rod Reiss and the last remaining member of the Reiss royal family. She was raised in isolation on one of the Reiss family estates until the fall of Wall Maria.

Shortly after, her mother was murdered in front of her, and Historia was coerced into renouncing her name and claim to the Reiss heritage, taking on the new identity of Krista Lenz (クリスタ・レンズ Kurisuta Renzu?), and entering military service, which was expected to result in her death.

Largely thanks to Ymir's influence, she graduated as the 10th best soldier within the 104th Training Corps and joined the Survey Corps. She eventually reclaimed her true name, becoming an important asset to the Corps and ascending to the throne after the success of the revolution against the government.  </p>
