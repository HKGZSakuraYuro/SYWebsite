           <h2 class="lead">Title</h2>
           <p>The original Japanese title, "Shingeki no Kyojin," has a dual meaning. The literal translation of the title is "Advancing Giant(s)" or "Attacking Giant(s)", with giants being <a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Titan" href="_blank">Titans</a> in the context of the series. In this way, the title can refer to both the advancing threat of the Titans or to a <a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_Titan" target="_blank">single attacking Titan</a>. </p>
           <br>
           <h2 class="lead">Plot</h2>
           <p class="p1">Main article:<a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline" target="_blank">Timeline</a></p>
           <p>Roughly a century before the beginning of the series, a mysterious race of giant, man-eating humanoids, known as <a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Titan" target="_blank">Titans</a>, suddenly appeared and nearly exterminated humanity. In order to protect themselves from this threat, the few survivors built three concentric <a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Walls" target="_blank">Walls</a>, called Maria, Rose, and Sheena, and encased themselves in this limited territory, forgetting everything about the outside world and the history before the building of the Walls. </p>
           <p>n the present, a boy named <a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Eren_Yeager" target="_blank">Eren Yeager</a>, his adopted sister <a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Mikasa_Ackerman" target="_blank">Mikasa Ackerman</a>, and their friend <a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Armin_Arlert" target="_blank">Armin Arlert</a>, dream about seeing the world outside the Walls some day; but their peace is abruptly interrupted when an unusual 60-meter tall <a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Colossus_Titan" target="_blank">Colossus Titan</a> and an <a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Armored_Titan" target="_blank">Armored Titan</a> breach the outermost Wall, and Eren sees his mother dying in the resulting devastation. Eren vows revenge against the Titans and later enlists in the military branch <a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Survey_Corps" target="_blank">Survey Corps</a>, accompanied by both Mikasa and Armin.</p>
           <p>As the story progresses, more mysteries surrounding the true origin and nature of the Titans, as well as the lost history of the world are addressed, and the reader gradually discovers that the Titans may not be the real enemies. Eren and the Survey Corps find themselves as the only remaining hope for their civilization, as they fight to uncover secrets from the past and stop the forces that want to bring about the destruction of mankind in the present and future. Hajime Isayama came up with the idea for the Titans when a drunk man grabbed his collar in an Internet cafe. <a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Hajime_Isayama" target="_blank">Isayama</a> said he was inspired by the man’s inability to communicate and reason even though they were of the same species. This encounter led him to believe that “the most familiar and scary animal in the world is actually the human.”[4] This idea is conveyed through the Titans: threatening beings which, despite their human-like appearances, lack any humanity. He also cited the visual novel Muv-Luv and the manga ARMS as primary influences for his work.[5][6]</p>
<p>
The scenery for the story was inspired by Isayama’s own hometown in the mountains. He often desired to go beyond the mountains, which influenced Eren's wish to go beyond the Walls in the series.[4] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wada" target="_blank">George Wada</a>, the producer of the anime, said that the concept of being isolated and overcoming a "Wall of Fear" was also inspired by the isolated and enclosed nature of the Japanese culture.[7]</p>
<p>
Isayama first drew a 65-page draft of the story in 2006[8] and offered it to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_Sh%C5%8Dnen_Jump" target="_blank">Weekly Shōnen Jump</a> department at Shueisha, but he was advised to modify his style and story to be more suitable for the magazine. He declined and instead took it to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_Sh%C5%8Dnen_Magazine" target="_blank">Weekly Shōnen Magazine</a> department at Kodansha, where it was accepted and began serialization in the first issue of its monthly spin-off <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessatsu_Sh%C5%8Dnen_Magazine" target="_blank">Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine</a> in September 2009.[9] He was 23 years old and that was the first series he had ever published.[4]</p>
<p>
His monthly schedule consists of one week for storyboard and three weeks for drawing.[10] When designing the Titans, he gets aid from a reference book for various human expressions;[4] as well as inspiration from real-life models such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yushin_Okami" target="_blank">Yushin Okami</a> for Eren's Titan form,[10] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Lesnar" target="_blank">Brock Lesnar</a> for the Armored Titan,[11] or the anime's voice actors.[12] He said that he chose giants as the theme for its work because "they are kind of gross."[13] His early drawings were rough, and he himself admitted that they were "amateurish" and felt that they were "short of the standard required for commercial works"; but it has been noted that they have greatly improved over the years.[14] His narrative puts much focus on the individual inner feelings of the characters.[7]</p>
<p>
Isayama has revealed that the story is planned far in advance and that he can even mark down in which specific <a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Attack_on_Titan_chapters" target="_blank">volume</a> a certain situation is going to happen; although it is not properly fleshed out until he is working on it.[6] He had also planned a tragic ending for the series in which everybody would die, similar to that of the film adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King" target="_blank">Stephen King</a>'s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mist_(film)"target="_blank">The Mist</a>; but after the manga and anime gained so many fans, he began to worry about the impact that such a conclusion could have on them, and now he is unsure of whether he should go ahead with it. However, he admitted that he still likes the idea.[15] </p>

 			<h3>Plot</h3>
 			<hr>
 			<p>The game retells key moments from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan" target="_blank">Attack on Titan manga</a> (chapters 1 through 33), which are also covered by the first season of the anime series, in addition to new scenarios involving the key characters.[5]</p>
	<p>
	In 845, when Eren was just 10 years old, the "Colossal Titan" suddenly appeared. Large enough to breach the Wall, it allowed other Titans to rampage through the city. One of them ate Carla, Eren's mother. With the so-called "Armored Titan" now preventing access, Wall Maria was abandoned and humanity were forced to fall back to Wall Rose. Having lost his family, his home and his dreams, Eren swore revenge on the Titans. Aiming to become a member of the Scout Regiment, he joined the "104th Cadet Corps."</p>
	<p>
	Five years after Eren enlisted, the "Colossal Titan" suddenly appeared again. Eren tried to fight it alone but failed to defeat it. He returned to headquarters and then takes a squad out himself, but the mission was a failure with Eren suffering a terrible injury to his leg and many soldiers being killed. When Armin was about to be eaten by a Titan, Eren sacrifices his life to save him. Immediately before the Trost District Wall was destroyed by the Colossal Titan, elite members of the Scout Regiment were on a mission outside the Wall. The principal role of the Scout Regiment was to scout beyond the Wall, seeking a way to take back Wall Maria which was lost 5 years previously. Setting up supply bases in destroyed towns and villages, they sought to secure a route for a large force to make their way to the Shiganshina District, where the Wall was destroyed. Fighting with the Titans outside the wall as they go, they sought to secure the route while making new discoveries along the way. </p>

    	   		<h3>Plot</h3>
    	   		<hr>
    	   		<p>One hundred years ago, the Titans suddenly appeared and decimated most of humanity. To stop their advance, humanity built a series of walls and lived peacefully there for another 100 years. In the present day village of Monzen, Eren expresses to his friends, Armin and Mikasa, his desire to leave the confines of the Outer Wall and see the outside world. After their failed attempt to approach the wall, Souda, the captain of the Garrison, explains to them that the military is assembling a scouting regiment to explore beyond the walls. However, the wall is suddenly attacked by the Colossal Titan. The wall is breached and Titans enter the village, eating people and getting back up despite being injured. When Mikasa tries to rescue a baby, she is separated from Eren, and is presumed killed.</p>


          <p>Two years later, Eren and Armin enter the Scout Regiment, along with Sasha, Jean, and others. The team, led by Military Police Commander: Kubal, move out into one of the towns of the Outer Wall. The group is then attacked by Titans but are saved by Captain Shikishima and Mikasa, who survived the attack from two years ago and is now part of the Scouts. Eren eventually confronts Mikasa and she reveals to him that the experience made her realize the world is cruel. After realizing that Mikasa and Shikishima are most likely together, Eren is once again devastated.</p>

          <h3>Development</h3>
          <hr><p>The film was announced on October 2011, with a planned release date in 2013[26] and in December of the same year it was announced that it would be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action" target="_blank">live action film</a>[27] and that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetsuya_Nakashima" target="_blank">Tetsuya Nakashima</a> would direct.[28] On December 2012 it was announced that Nakashima had left as director because of creative differences.[29] On December 2013, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinji_Higuchi" target="_blank">Shinji Higuchi</a> was revealed as the new director and Yuusuke Watanabe as the screenwriter.[citation needed] Originally, the filmmakers wanted to make the film very faithful to the source material, but author Hajime Isayama suggested numerous changes (such as introducing new and different characters, and changing the setting to Japan) to make the films standalone, because "the story has already been told", while also introducing new elements that would later be used in the manga. Another thing to note is that the films may or may not be a sequel to the 1966 Toho film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Gargantuas" target="_blank">The War of the Gargantuas</a>.</p>
